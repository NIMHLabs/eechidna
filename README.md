The Mother of All Coding Project Monsters

Going to begin tossing in crappy parts of this. It will eventually improve as 
things go along.

Here is the DOM-Muse branch. Keeping with the Greek Diamones/Monster theme of 
naming, I will be having various prerecongised data holding systems that are
common enough to require some kind of specialised handling to be listed as
Muses within this system.

There will likely be a PDF-Muse, a Parrot-Muse, a JVM-Muse, a CSM-Muse, 
a Adobe-Flash-Muse (if possible), ObjC-Muse in amongst anything else that has 
me trying to make use of somebody else's standard/system for keeping stuff 
straight all up in this biotch.

Any virtual machine, documentation handling format, etc that will be based 
upon my own design (taking in information from the others) will likely be
call a Sibylline-Machine. Technically, eEchidna in and of itself will a form
of Sibylline Machine in its grand function... as a lot of the code is designed
to handle situations that do not exist yet, and to be patched based upon 
new knowledge of those situations that have not existed yet being experienced
to help those parts work better.
