The Mother of All Coding Project Monsters

The purpose of this branch, Kallisti-ObjC is to work as a nativity 
layer for various projects that make use of the ObjC virtual machine.
As hinted by the prefix of Kallisti (shoot, am I doing postfixes or prefixes?
swagevers...), it will be to allow various Apple products to be able to be 
filtered through eEchidna.

In this case ObjC code and virtual machine stuffs will either be dynamically
recompiled into the local virtual machine--or this might even be the local
virtual machine being used. I plan to offer stuff being processed by CMS, 
Parrot, JVM, ObjC, and what not. Er... CMS is whatever Mono and .Net use that
I keep messing up the name for it. Since eEchidna is so framework orientated 
it is just plain unreal, this should really not be that hard. I mean, to 
initially set up. To debug it will be a fucking pain in that of which I shall
not covet my neighbour's having.

Since Apple Computers is kind of a bit weird cray cray and psycho about how 
they have their stuff (in my personal opinion... if I say that, this is now
no longer Libel)... I am going to name the nativity stuff "Kallisti" keeping
with the eEchidna theme.

I wonder if I could write "Kallisti" on an iPad or iPhone and toss it into 
a few weddings...

The idea is to have eEchidna eventually able to understand iTunes, iOS apps
and what not... if not just run them with like five thousand fucking glitches.
Seriously... this working seamlessly? HA! HA HA HA! A fun thing to fuck 
around with in a bit of software which is pretty much aware it will never
get anywhere but experimental? FUCKING HELLZ YEAH! Even more so when I do
plan to pull various eEchidna code and use it in programs that actually plan
to be completen.
