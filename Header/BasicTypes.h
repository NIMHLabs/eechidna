 * Author: Katrina Payne
 * Creation Date: 2014 June 23
 *
 * This is me working to start on creating a basic implementation of DOM
 * in the Sybilline Program eEchidna style. This DOM implementation may be
 * modified to have each part of DOM as a seperate Chromosome.
 *
 * == Changelog
 * * 2014 June 23 -- Created this document
 *
 * == TODO
 * * Make this not completely suck
